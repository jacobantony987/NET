\begin{theorem}[Cayley-Hamilton]
	Every matrix $A \in M_n(F)$ satisfies its characteristic equation $det(A-xI) \in F[x]$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[minimal polynomial]
	The minimal polynomial of a square matrix $A$ is the unique, monic polynomial $p$ of least degree satisfied by $A$. ie, $p(A) = 0$.
\end{definition}
